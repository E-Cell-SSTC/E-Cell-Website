                    Innovation and design thinking is for anyone willing to change their mindset, not only about
                    challenges and problem solving, but also about creating something new. We believe great innovators
                    and leaders need to be great design thinkers. Holding on to this faith that design thinking is a
                    catalyst for innovation and bringing new things into the world.
